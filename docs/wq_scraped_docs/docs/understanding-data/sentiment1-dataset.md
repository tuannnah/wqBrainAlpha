**Getting Started with sentiment1 dataset (Research Sentiment Data)**

* The sentiment1 dataset combines sentiment metrics with earnings estimations and surprises for U.S.-listed companies.
* It provides insights into market mood, analyst consensus, and earnings-based signals.
* Key fields include sentiment scores, ratios of analyst buy/sell recommendations, earnings surprises, and dispersion among analyst estimates.
* Sentiment scores are dynamic with higher turnover in nature, while analyst and earnings metrics are slower-moving signals.
* Use smoothing **decay** operations to manage high-frequency sentiment data and be considerate when using long lookback periods (>63 days) as older events may lose relevance.
* The dataset has coverage of approximately 2000 on TOP3000. Do try your ideas on more liquid universes such as TOP1000 and TOPSP500 but ensure sufficient long & short count to avoid overfitting.

**Example Alpha Ideas**

* Positive sentiment indicates market confidence, while negative sentiment signals potential downside. Go long on stocks with bullish sentiment (**snt1\_cored1\_score** > 5) and short on stocks with bearish sentiment (**snt1\_cored1\_score** < -5).
* Positive earnings surprises often lead to upward price movements. Go long on stocks with positive earnings surprises using **snt1\_d1\_earningssurprise**.
* A strong analyst consensus combined with sufficient analyst coverage reflects market confidence. Go long on stocks with a high ratio of analyst buys over sells using **snt1\_d1\_buyrecpercent**, filtering out stocks with low analyst coverage with **snt1\_d1\_analystcoverage**
