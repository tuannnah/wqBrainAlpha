**Getting Started with model53 dataset (Creditworthiness Risk Measure Model)**

* The model53 dataset provides comprehensive default probability measures and credit risk indicators for public companies. This dataset enables you to assess the credit worthiness of companies using multiple models with varying time horizons, providing a full term structure of default probabilities based on company-specific attributes, industry measures, and macroeconomic factors.
* The term structure of default probabilities provides a comprehensive view of a company's credit risk profile across multiple time horizons, similar to how a yield curve displays interest rates across different maturities. This construct offers investors unique insights that other measures cannot provide.
  + **Shape Interpretation:** An upward-sloping term structure (where long-term default risk exceeds short-term) represents normal conditions, while flat or inverted structures (short-term risk ≥ long-term risk) often signal acute financial distress or market concerns about imminent problems.
  + **Relative Steepness:** The degree of steepness in the default probability curve indicates the market's perception of how a company's credit quality will evolve. A steeply upward curve suggests gradual deterioration, while a mildly sloped curve indicates stable expectations.
  + **Structural Changes:** Shifts in the term structure's shape often precede significant equity price movements. A flattening curve after a period of steepness frequently signals improving long-term prospects that equity markets may not have fully priced in.

**Example Alpha Ideas**

* **Default Curve Steepness (mdl53\_jc5\_5year - mdl53\_jc5\_1year)**: The steepness of the default probability curve reveals market expectations about a company's trajectory. Go long on stocks where the curve is flattening after being steep (declining long-term relative to short-term risk) as this indicates improving long-run prospects, and short stocks developing a rapidly steepening curve that signals deteriorating future outlook.
* **Default Curve Inversion (mdl53\_jc5\_1year > mdl53\_jc5\_5year)**: An inverted default probability curve, where short-term default risk exceeds long-term risk, often signals acute but potentially temporary distress. Go long on fundamentally sound companies experiencing short-term default curve inversions during market stress periods, as these anomalies typically mean-revert when liquidity conditions normalize.
* **Default Probability Rate-of-Change Δ (Δmdl53\_jc6\_1year)**: The second derivative of default probability captures acceleration in credit quality changes. Go long on companies where default probability deterioration is decelerating after a spike and short companies where the rate of default probability increase is accelerating using **sign()** and **ts\_delta()** operator, as markets typically underreact to inflection points in credit quality momentum.
