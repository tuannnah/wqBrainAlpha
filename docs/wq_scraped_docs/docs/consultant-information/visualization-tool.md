# Visualization Tool

The visualization feature allows users to plot graphs of Alpha values and statistics, in addition to the PnL graph. It enables users to analyze the visualized output and fine tune Alphas before re-simulating or submitting.

Running the visualization has an impact on simulation speed, so be judicious in utilizing this feature. By default this feature is turned off but can be turned on in simulation settings. Visualization data for older Alphas is only available for a week after simulation date.

| Term | Usage |
| --- | --- |
| Coverage | Number or percentage of instruments with non-NAN Alpha values |
| Size | Amount of money allocated as percentage of booksize |
| PNL | PNL attributed to the relevant set of instruments |
| Sharpe | Sharpe value of associated PNL stream |
| Capitalization | Quintile of market capitalization of underlying stock |
| Industry / Sector | Market grouping (scroll down to the bottom of the page for the full list of sectors and industries) |

# Tips to Analyze the Graphs

1. Highly varying turnover or average Alpha value with time should be avoided.
2. Very large booksize concentrated on low cap or one sector or industry is not good, as it potentially entails low liquidity or diversification.
3. Filtering out a lot of stocks in your simulation leading to less diversification across caps, sector or industry is not a good practice. This could be checked using the coverage plots.
4. Sharpe contribution from different industries and sectors towards the overall Sharpe indicates diversification.
5. Good Sharpe in high cap stocks along with low caps makes a good Alpha.
