# Characteristics of the EUR TOP2500 Universe

The EUR TOP2500 universe expands from the TOP1200, covering around 2500 instruments. This offers a broader area for analysis.

# Tips for Success

* Resimulate your TOP1200 Alphas on the new TOP2500 universe.
* Adapt GLB region Alphas to the EUR TOP2500 universe.
* Start with datasets in price volume, analyst, fundamental, option, and short interest categories.
* In addition to sub-universe test, check Alpha's performance on the TOP800 universe to evaluate performance on liquid instruments.
* **Apply Double Neutralization**:
  + With the expanded EUR TOP2500 universe, more instruments are available within each group. This increased number of instruments per group enhances the reliability and robustness of your Alphas.
  + **Country Neutralization**: Remove country-specific risk by neutralizing by country mean values.
  + **Sector/Industry Neutralization**: Further refine by neutralizing by sector or industry.
  + **Example**: new\_group = group\_cartesian\_product(country, industry), or new\_group = densify(country) + densify(industry)\*100
* Neutralize EUR Alphas against a group of risk factors using group neutralize operators or use SLOW, FAST, SLOW\_AND\_FAST, CROWDING, STATISTICAL neutralization in settings.

Take advantage of the expanded EUR TOP2500 universe for more reliable and robust Alphas.

Happy simulating!
