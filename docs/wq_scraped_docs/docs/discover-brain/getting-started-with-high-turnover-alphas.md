# Discover BRAIN / Getting Started with High Turnover Alphas

This guide is a BRAIN-focused starting point for researchers who want to develop high turnover Alphas.

# What is a High Turnover Alpha?

A high turnover Alpha is an Alpha that refreshes positions frequently and derives a meaningful share of its value from short-horizon signals. Turnover above 20% is the main starting point for identifying this style.

We are seeking to find signals that remain economically useful even when positions update rapidly and the effective holding horizon is short.

# Why are High Turnover Alphas important?

* **Diversification:** High TVR alphas have different return profiles and lower correlation to traditional low-turnover signals.
* **Signal freshness:** Shorter horizons mean faster signal decay and quicker incorporation of new information.
* **Complementary approach:** Adds orthogonal return sources to existing portfolio construction.

# Characteristics of High Turnover Alphas

Good high turnover research usually has the following characteristics:

* Signal updates quickly enough to justify frequent re-ranking or position changes.
* Performance is not concentrated in a tiny set of dates or instruments.
* The alpha still looks sensible after realistic constraints or more investable settings are applied.
* The idea can be explained in terms of why information should arrive and decay quickly.

# How can you develop High Turnover Alphas?

The most common mistake is to target turnover directly instead of targeting a short-lived source of information. High turnover should be a consequence of the idea, not the idea itself.

A better workflow is:

1. Start from an intuition about a fast-moving effect.
2. Choose fields that update at the right frequency and have enough breadth.
3. Build a simple alpha that expresses that effect clearly.
4. Check whether the alpha naturally lands in a high-turnover regime.
5. Stress the idea under real-world market conditions, universe, and cost-aware variants.

# Actionable tips to potentially improve High TVR research quality

* **Favor changes over levels:** deltas, surprises, accelerations, and revision-like constructs often suit shorter horizons better than static levels.
* **Use conditional logic carefully:** gating on liquidity, attention, or event states can help the signal act when the mechanism is most plausible.
* **Think cross-sectionally:** many high turnover ideas are strongest as relative-value rankings rather than absolute thresholds.
* **Respect real-world market conditions:** a signal that only works in the tail of the least liquid names is less useful.
* **Prefer simple, repeatable constructions:** if you cannot explain why a transform helps, it is possibly overfitting.

# Potential Steps to develop High TVR Alphas

**Step 1: Start with a clean base alpha**

Use a simple construction first. Avoid stacking many transforms or interactions in the first version. A compact first draft makes it much easier to understand whether the underlying idea really carries short-horizon information.

**Step 2: Validate the signal mechanics**

Check whether the signal is actually moving often enough, whether coverage is acceptable, and whether the cross-section behaves sensibly.

**Step 3: Observe turnover as an outcome**

After building the initial alpha, inspect whether turnover naturally exceeds the threshold. Do not force turnover higher by adding unnecessary noise or unstable transforms.

**Step 4: Test for robustness under realistic variants**

Good High TVR alphas should be checked in settings that make them more realistic and more investable. Important directions include after-cost behavior, behavior under constraints, performance in more liquid subuniverses, and behavior after orthogonalization.

**Step 5: Expand only after the base idea survives**

Once the base version is credible, explore variants such as alternate normalizations, event windows, industry-relative forms, or interaction terms.

# Potential sources of ideas for High TVR Alphas

High turnover alphas tend to come from signals whose informational edge decays quickly. Useful starting directions include:

* **Event reaction:** signals linked to earnings, guidance, revisions, filings, news flow, or other updates that produce short-lived repricing.
* **Flow and activity:** changes in analyst behavior, execution-related activity, attention, or user activity proxies that may transmit information quickly.
* **Microstructure-sensitive effects:** signals that behave differently across liquidity buckets, constraints, or market regimes.
* **Short-horizon fundamental refresh:** fast-moving fundamental deltas, estimate revisions, surprise-like quantities, or near-term changes rather than slow levels.
* **Interaction ideas:** combining a fast catalyst with a slower conditioning variable such as quality, crowding, seasonality, or industry context.

# Understanding High Turnover Alpha Classifications

The BRAIN platform recognizes four distinct categories of High TVR alphas. Each classification targets a different aspect of robustness and real-world market conditions.

## Base Eligibility Criteria

An alpha qualifies as High TVR if it meets ALL of the following:

* **Region:** USA
* **Turnover:** > 20%
* **Return preservation:** hightvrReturns / original alpha return > 0.75

## Classification 1: After Cost HighTVR Alphas

**Focus:** Alphas that remain profitable after accounting for execution costs.

**Criteria:** Sharpe after applying cost > 1.0

## Classification 2: Investable HighTVR Alphas

**Focus:** Alphas that maintain performance under realistic constraints.

**Criteria (one of):**

* Sharpe after maxtrade > 2.0 AND Turnover after maxtrade > 20%
* Sharpe after maxpos > 2.0 AND Turnover after maxpos > 20%

## Classification 3: Liquid HighTVR Alphas

**Focus:** Alphas that perform well in liquid instruments.

**Criteria:**

* Sharpe in TOP200 > 1.0
* Sharpe ratio: sharpe\_top500 / sharpe\_top200 > 0.7

## Classification 4: Orthogonal HighTVR Alphas

**Focus:** Alphas that provide returns orthogonal to existing production signals.

**Criteria:** Submit-able after applying RAM neutralization

# Common mistakes to watch for

Watch for these issues when developing high turnover alphas:

* **Artificial turnover:** turnover rises because the alpha is noisy, unstable, or overly reactive rather than informative.
* **Single-test dependence:** performance only looks good in one universe, one cost assumption, or one constrained setting.
* **Weak economic story:** the alpha is a chain of operators without a clear reason for short-horizon predictive power.
* **Coverage fragility:** the field only works for a narrow subset of names or dates.
* **Parameter mining:** small changes in windows or ranks flip the result dramatically.

# Tips for Success

* Does the alpha naturally operate above the high-turnover threshold?
* Is there a clear short-horizon reason for why the signal should work?
* Have you checked the idea in at least one realism-aware direction?
* Is the performance not entirely dependent on a fragile parameter choice?
* Does the dataset choice make sense for a fast-decaying signal?
* Can you explain what the alpha is capturing in one or two sentences?
* Does the alpha still look reasonable when simplified?

High turnover research works well when you treat it as short-horizon information research, not as a mechanical turnover optimization exercise. Good ideas usually come from understanding why information should arrive, how quickly it should decay, and what market frictions it may survive.

If you keep the idea clear, use datasets intentionally, and test realism early, you are much more likely to produce high turnover alphas that are genuinely useful.
