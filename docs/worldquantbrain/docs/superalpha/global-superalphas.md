# SuperAlpha / Global SuperAlphas

<https://api.worldquantbrain.com/tutorial-pages/getting-started-global-superalphas>

Creating Global (GLB) SuperAlphas requires careful consideration, including neutralization, component Alpha selection, and simulation settings.

**Neutralization**

* Neutralize your SuperAlpha to **COUNTRY** to account for differences across countries in the global region.
* This ensures fair comparisons and avoids biases caused by regional disparities.
* Neutralization to country helps align signals across diverse regions.

**Universe selection**

* The **MINVOL1M GLB** universe contains over 9,000 instruments, which can make simulations slower.
* To speed up simulations, test your SuperAlpha on the **TOP3000** universe.
* Once optimized, simulate and submit your SuperAlpha on the **MINVOL1M** universe.

**Selection Expression**

* Select Alphas that are neutralized to **country** using the following methods:
  + **Select Alphas neutralized in expression**: *in(datafields, 'country')*
  + **Select Alphas neutralized in settings**: neutralization == 'COUNTRY'
* Choose Alphas with **1-2 years of OS data** to ensure reliability:
  + Use the selection expression: *os\_start\_date <= '2022-01-23'*
* Combine multiple selections using the **OR operator** to diversify your component Alphas and improve overall performance.
  + This allows you to include a broader range of signals in your SuperAlpha.

**Combo Expression**

* Use the **combo\_a operator** to combine Alphas effectively.
  + This operator performs better when the selected Alphas are **different**.
  + Avoid selecting overly similar Alphas to maximize the effectiveness of the combo.

**Simulation settings**

* Enable the **Max Trade setting** during simulation, especially on the **MINVOL1M** universe.
  + This ensures your SuperAlpha meets liquidity and scalability requirements.
  + It validates that your SuperAlpha can handle real-world constraints.

**Tips for Success**

* **Diversify selection**: Use multiple selection expressions to ensure a broad range of Alphas in your SuperAlpha.
* **Focus on liquidity**: Simulating on the **TOP3000** universe speeds up testing, while submitting on **MINVOL1M** ensures scalability. Additionally, check **Investability constrained metrics** of your SuperAlpha.
* **Test OS performance**: Prioritize Alphas with sufficient OS data to avoid overfitting and ensure robust performance.
