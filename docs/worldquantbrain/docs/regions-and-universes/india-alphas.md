<https://api.worldquantbrain.com/tutorial-pages/getting-started-india-alphas>

## Introduction

India universe on BRAIN consists of the top 500 stocks by liquidity.

Normal Alpha tests are applied, including Sharpe, fitness, sub-universe Sharpe, IS ladder etc.

Max Trade is not mandatory in IND, and maximum turnover cap is 40%.

IND need to pass an additional **robust universe Sharpe test**: IND Alpha should have minimum Sharpe of 1, in liquid stocks selected by BRAIN.

## Tips for Success

**IND stocks are not included in ASI universes**, also **many data appear in both ASI and IND**, so we encourage **retrying your ASI Alphas in IND**. Alphas that do well in both universes, may be strong candidates.

Try **diverse data categories**, while it can lead to better combined performance.

Though maxtrade is optional, we still encourage **keeping the investability constrained PnL to have a reasonable performance**.

Though max turnover is 40%, however we still encourage to **lower the turnover** if possible. Having **high margin**, with turnover lower than 20% is a good practice.
